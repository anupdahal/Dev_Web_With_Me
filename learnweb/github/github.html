  <h1>  <b>What is Git?</b> <br></h1>
Git is a version control system used for tracking changes in computer files, making it a top-rated utility for programmers world-wide. Git can handle projects of any size.
<br><br>
Git is used to coordinate the workflow among project team members and track their progress over time. It also benefits both programmers and non-technical users by keeping track of their project files. Git allows multiple users to work together without disrupting each other’s work. 
<br><br>
Now that you've been introduced to Git, you have the foundation needed to understand what is GitHub better.
<br><br>
<h1><b>What is GitHub?</b> <br></h1>
GitHub is a Git repository hosting service that provides a web-based graphical interface. It is the world’s largest coding community. Putting a code or a project into GitHub brings it increased, widespread exposure. Programmers can find source codes in many different languages and use the command-line interface, Git, to make and keep track of any changes.
<br><br>
GitHub helps every team member work together on a project from any location while facilitating collaboration. You can also review previous versions created at an earlier point in time.
<br><br>
So now we know what Git and GitHub are. Time to gain a better understanding of the importance and relevance of what is GitHub by exploring its features.
<br><br>
<h1><b>What are GitHub’s Features?</b> <br></h1>
1. Easy Project Management <br>
GitHub is a place where project managers and developers come together to coordinate, track, and update their work so that projects are transparent and stay on schedule.
<br><br>
2. Increased Safety With Packages <br>
Packages can be published privately, within the team, or publicly to the open-source community. The packages can be used or reused by downloading them from GitHub.
<br><br>
3. Effective Team Management <br>
GitHub helps all the team members stay on the same page and organized. Moderation tools like Issue and Pull Request Locking help the team to focus on the code.
<br><br>
4. Improved Code Writing <br>
Pull requests help the organizations to review, develop, and propose new code. Team members can discuss any implementations and proposals through these before changing the source code.
<br><br>
5. Increased Code Safety <br>
GitHub uses dedicated tools to identify and analyze vulnerabilities to the code that other tools tend to miss. Development teams everywhere work together to secure the software supply chain, from start to finish.
<br><br>
6. Easy Code Hosting <br>
All the code and documentation are in one place. There are millions of repositories on GitHub, and each repository has its own tools to help you host and release code.
